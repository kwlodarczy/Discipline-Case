# Discipline-Case

Files to print a case for the Discipline Kit. This case is designed for M2x4mm threaded inserts, these can be heated up and pushed into the holes.

I printed this on an Anycubic Chiron with a 0.2mm layer height and 10% infill. With 5 solid top, bottom and walls the print time was around 26 hours.
